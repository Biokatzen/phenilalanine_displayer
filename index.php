     <p>Easily visualize your protein sequences with our user-friendly tool, converting complex FASTA files into clear visualizations with the option to highlight phenylalanine amino acids. First, go to the submit page and follow the steps below to get started.</p>
     <ol>
         <h3>Input your data</h3>
         <li><strong>Upload a FASTA File</strong></li>
         <p>Select a multifasta file from your computer to upload. This file should contain your protein sequences formatted in FASTA format.</p>
         <li><strong>Pick an Eel to Highlight</strong></li>
         <p>Choose your favorite eel from our selection. This eel will represent your sequences during visualization, adding a fun touch to your data presentation.</p>
         <h3>Set Parameters</h3>
         <li><strong>Color Phenylalanine</strong></li>
         <p>Use this option to toggle whether phenylalanine residues (F) are highlighted in teal. This helps to quickly identify and analyze these residues in your sequences.</p>
         <li><strong>Enter Amino Acids per Line</strong></li>
         <p>Specify how many amino acids you want to disply on each line.</p>
     </ol>
