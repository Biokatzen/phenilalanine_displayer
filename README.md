# PHEENILALANINE DISPLAYER
## Description
This is a protein sequence displayer for the following eel species. 
All you need to do is input the fasta file added in this repository which include the sequences of each eel specie.
You can choose an specific specie and highlight the phenilalanines in the sequence as well as choose the number of nucleotides you want to display on each line.
## Use
Just download all the files of this repository and place them in a separate folder in Fedora. Then move to that folder in the terminal and execute the following command:
php -S localhost:8080
A firefox page should appear with the homepage. Then using the navigation bar you can move to the submit page to upload the fasta file, choose the specie, select if you want the phenilalanines highlighted and type the number of nucleotides you want to display on each line
Make sure you have php and firefox installed in your virtual machine (if you are using one) or in your system directly.
In my case I am using Fedora workstation live x86_64-38-1.6 and VirtualBox as a Virtual Machine
